As Head of the CNAV Lab at Sharif University, I lead a team applying deep learning and optimal control to robotics challenges, from in-motion transfer alignment to differential-game strategies. Guided by a simple motto—“always learning, always improving”—I strive to turn curiosity into practical solutions and to mentor the next generation of engineers in thoughtful, incremental innovation.
