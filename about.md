I am a highly motivated graduate student at Sharif University of Technology, specializing in robotics, reinforcement learning, and embedded machine learning. My research focuses on optimizing robotic control systems and enhancing real-time decision-making, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

I completed my B.Sc. with the Best Undergraduate Thesis Award from the Iranian Aerospace Society for my work on controlling a 3-DOF quadcopter platform using Differential Game Theory and Nash Equilibrium. This recognition reflects my commitment to excellence and passion for developing innovative solutions in robotics and control systems.

Currently, my masterâ€™s thesis involves designing and implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for robotics on embedded hardware, bridging AI and robotics to solve complex, real-world challenges. In addition to my research, I have contributed to projects involving multi-agent systems and advanced game theory-based optimization, achieving significant results in both simulations and hardware applications.

I am always open to new opportunities to collaborate, learn, and push the boundaries of robotics technology.
