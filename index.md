<!-- [Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to use this space to write your biography here, edit the `index.md` file. You can put a picture in, too. Rename your picture to `profile.png` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.

PS: If you liked the theme, do star it on GitHub! -->

I am an aerospace engineer specializing in autonomous systems and reinforcement learning. With an M.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology, my work bridges control theory and AI—in particular, developing embedded RL controllers that outperform classical methods under real-world constraints. I was honored with the Best B.Sc. Thesis Award from the Iranian Aerospace Society for my undergraduate research, in which I modeled and designed a 3-DoF motion platform controller using differential-game theory, implementing it in Simulink/C to achieve robust stability and precise tracking under changing load conditions.

As Head of the CNAV Lab at Sharif University, I lead a team applying deep learning and optimal control to robotics challenges, from in-motion transfer alignment to differential-game strategies. Guided by a simple motto—“always learning, always improving”—I strive to turn curiosity into practical solutions and to mentor the next generation of engineers in thoughtful, incremental innovation.
