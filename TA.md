# Teaching & CNAV Lab Mentorship

---

Since my third semester at Sharif University of Technology, I have been actively involved in teaching and mentoring students. I began as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Fundamentals of Programming (C/C++) course, where I had the opportunity to assist students in understanding the fundamentals of programming. This experience sparked my passion for teaching and helped me realize how rewarding it is to guide students through challenging concepts in computer programming and problem-solving. Over the years, I have had the privilege of serving as a TA for several other courses, including Automatic Control, Control Lab, Dynamics, and Aircraft Design.

At Sharif University, my role as a TA has allowed me to work closely with students, guiding them through course material, conducting lab sessions, and providing feedback on their assignments and projects. I’ve helped students tackle complex concepts in control theory and dynamic systems, while also emphasizing the importance of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. In my role as a TA, I’ve also been involved in preparing lab assignments and creating course materials that help students bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

In addition to my academic responsibilities, I have also been deeply involved with CNAV Lab at Sharif University, a center for cutting-edge research in robotics and autonomous systems. I initially joined CNAV Lab as a Researcher and later progressed to the role of Lab Leader. Throughout my time there, I have worked on numerous research projects involving embedded systems and machine learning for robotic control. One of my key responsibilities was to assist in the development of Arduino-based controllers and other embedded hardware solutions for various experimental setups in the lab. This hands-on experience has allowed me to refine my skills in hardware programming, low-level coding, and system integration.




At CNAV Lab, I’ve also had the opportunity to work on coding for different plant models, using a variety of platforms and tools such as Arduino, C/C++, and Embedded C. I’ve been responsible for designing and implementing control systems for various robotic platforms, ensuring that they operate effectively in real-time conditions. Working on these projects has given me a deep understanding of how to optimize hardware and software interactions, particularly in the context of resource-constrained embedded systems.

Below is a snapshot of the hardware platforms we use every semester.

* **3‑DoF Quadrotor Attitude Stand** — tune LQR / Differential‑Game and RL controllers to keep the platform level under step‑torque disturbances.

</p>

* **Suspended Ball (Ball‑Beam) Plant** — image‑based feedback plus PID ↔ RL comparisons for set‑point tracking and disturbance rejection.

* **Cubli Reaction‑Wheel Cube** — reaction‑wheel cube that jumps up and balances on one corner; students design PID/LQR stabilisers and deploy PPO swing‑up policies on STM32.

Working with these plants gives students the full‑stack perspective—from high‑level control design to low‑level **Arduino / STM32 C/C++ firmware**, ROS 2 networking, and real‑time data acquisition—preparing them for cutting‑edge robotics research and development.

Additionally, I currently serve as a Section Leader for Stanford University’s Code in Place program, where I mentor international learners in Python programming. This role has allowed me to develop my teaching skills further, as I guide students through coding challenges, provide feedback on their work, and help them overcome obstacles in their learning journey. I also conduct office hours where I assist students with understanding Python concepts and problem-solving techniques.

Through all these experiences, my primary teaching philosophy has remained the same: to help students approach problems with a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on application. I believe that teaching should be dynamic, engaging, and intellectually stimulating, with a strong focus on creating an environment where students feel comfortable exploring new ideas, asking questions, and developing their skills. By combining my academic experiences and hands-on work in the lab, I strive to inspire my students to think critically and apply their learning to real-world problems.
